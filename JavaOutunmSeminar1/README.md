Listed problems

- A Game could have less than two players 
  - make sure it always has at least two.

- A Game could have 7 players, make it have at most 6.
  - or slightly easier allow for 7 players or more
- A player that get’s into prison always stays there
  - Other than just fixing the bug, try to understand what’s wrong with the design and fix the root cause
  
- The deck could run out of questions
  - Make sure that can’t happen (a deck with 1 billion questions is cheating :)

- Introducing new categories of questions seems like tricky business.
  - Could you make sure all places have the “right” question and that the distribution is always correct?
- Similarly changing the board size greatly affects the questions distribution
